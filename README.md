# 💸 UPI Fraud Detection System

A full-stack application for detecting potential fraud in UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions and associated text messages. Built with **Gradio** (Frontend) and **Flask** (Backend), this system demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning into a practical and interactive web-based fraud detection tool.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates a hybrid fraud detection system capable of analyzing:
- Text messages (e.g., phishing SMS or chat)
- Transaction details (amounts, balances, transaction types)
- Or both simultaneously for a **comprehensive** analysis

> ⚠️ *Note: Fraud detection logic is simplified for demonstration using rule-based and keyword-matching methods.*
